            <h2><a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/toys/etch-a-sketch/" target="_blank">The history behind the toy</a></h2>
            <p>French electrical technician Andr√© Cassagnes applied his experience with the clinging properties of an electrostatic charge to invent a mechanical drawing toy with no spare parts. He called his creation L‚ÄôEcran Magique, the magic screen.</p>
            <p>Introduced at the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg, Germany, in 1959, the gadget failed to draw much attention. Numerous manufacturers passed over a chance to pick up the new toy, concluding that Cassagnes wanted too much money for it. However, the Ohio Art Company took a second look and invested $25,000, more than they had ever paid for a license. Ohio Art renamed the toy ‚ÄúEtch A Sketch‚Äù and began mass production later that year. Saturation advertising on television turned the toy into a must-have item for Christmas, 1960, and Ohio Art‚Äôs factory worked feverishly until noon that Christmas Eve. Etch A Sketch has changed little since then.</p>
            <p>Static charges hold a mixture of aluminum powder and tiny plastic beads to the inside of a clear plastic screen. Knobs control the horizontal and vertical rods that move a stylus where the two meet. The point scores a line across the screen‚Äôs reverse side. Experts can draw a curved or diagonal line. Turning the screen over and giving it a shake erases the picture.</p>

            <h2>How to use this?</h2>
            <p>Click on one of the buttons on the Etch A Sketch and start hovering over the drawing frame. 
                The currently active button is smaller than the others (because it's being pressed). Alternatively, you can 
                press the keys "b"/"g"/"r"/"e"/"c" while your cursor is over the canvas and the active button will change as well.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>‚ö´ Key "b" for the black button</li>
                <li>üü¢ Key "g" for the green button</li>
                <li>üåà Key "r" for the random button</li>
                <li>üßΩ Key "e" for the eraser button</li>
                <li>üßπ Key "c" for the clear button (clears the canvas)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The random üåà mode is special: it'll color the target rectangle a random color.</p>
